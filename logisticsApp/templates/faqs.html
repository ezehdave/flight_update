						<h6><a id="question2"><b>WHAT CHEAP SHIPPING SERVICE CAN I USE?</b> </a></h6>
						<p>Our economy shipping services are the most cost-effective way to ship a package whether you need to send your item in the US or overseas.

                               If your package is not urgent, you can save considerable amounts of money using economy services rather than expedited and they usually are shipped in a standard time frame in the USA of no more than a week.

						<p>Here, we have longstanding relationships with a variety shipping companies and carriers meaning that due to the consistent high volumes of packages we help our customers ship, we have access to discounted shipping rates.

                           This close working relationship has now developed into us offering shipping space on our marketplace so that they can market their best shipping rates to ordinary consumers and small to medium business that they would not normally have access to.

						<h2><a id="question5"><b>Frequently asked questions on packaging</b>  </a></h2>
						<h6><b>HOW SHOULD I PACKAGE MY PARCEL?</b></h6>

						<p>
							Before you decide how to send a package you should ensure your parcels are packed well enough to be transported safely across long distances, potentially being passed through a range of vehicles and warehouses depending on where you are shipping to.

                          <br>Use a sturdy, heavy-duty cardboard box to prevent any damage to the goods inside.
                          <br>If the items inside are fragile, make sure they are wrapped separately. Fill any spaces in the box with polystyrene chips.
                            <br>Seal any openings of the box with layers of tape to ensure the box does not open.

						<h6><a id="question6"><b>DO YOU OFFER SHIPMENT PACKAGING SERVICES?</b> </a></h6>
						<p>
							We are not able to offer a packaging service. We simply pair you up with a carrier services who can collect and deliver your goods, so we can’t provide any packing service in our business model. What we can do is give you an avenue to track the status of your package through our tracking system.

                    <div class="form-title">
						<h6><a id="question7"><b>HOW IS MY PACKAGE HANDLED DURING SHIPPING?</b> </a></h6>
						<p>Parcels being shipped to your recipient are going to be in transit with thousands of other boxes of all shapes, sizes, and weights. The box will move through vast delivery networks, on planes, in vans, and through transportation depots.

                           This means your package may be moved by machines, so it is imperative you package your shipment correctly to minimize the risk of damage occurring. This is why fragile items are included on the prohibited items list as a vast carrier network is not suitable for glass, liquids or other items that can be easily broken or spilled.

						<h2><a id="question8"><b>Frequently asked questions on documents</b>  </a></h2>
						<h6><b>WHAT DOCUMENTS DO YOU NEED TO ATTACH FOR SHIPPING WITHIN THE EU?</b></h6>

						<p>
							For items that are being shipped within the EU you will simply need the our Logistics Shipping Label which you can get while placing an order for shipment.

                            Attach all shipping labels securely to the package as this will be needed by the carriers to deliver the goods safely. Some carrier services will have more than one shipping label, please ensure both are attached as they will both be needed. One label will take the package to a sort facility, where it will be sorted and processed and the other label used to locate the final delivery address.

                            Always provide a recipient contact telephone number and email in case the carrier has any issues making the delivery.

						<h6><a id="question9"><b>WHAT DOCUMENTS DO YOU NEED TO ATTACH FOR SHIPPING OUTSIDE OF THE EU?</b> </a></h6>
						<p>
							Any shipping customs documents required for your package to be delivered will be provided at the time of booking.

                           Make sure you give a full breakdown of the contents in your package such as full description of the clothes you are sending like 1x Red T- Shirt, not something generic like clothing, as it will cause you a delay in the delivery.

                           Likewise check the prohibited items list before you send, or customs will remove any items that are not allowed and dispose of them, or simply return the package at the expense of the shipper.

						<h2><a id="question10"><b>Frequently asked questions on customs and fees</b>  </a></h2>
						<h6><b>HOW DO I COMPLETE A CUSTOMS DECLARATION FORM?</b></h6>

						<p>
							If you are new to shipping packages internationally, then completing a customs declaration form can appear to be a complex issue. However, we makes this process nice and easy, as we collect all the relevant customs information for your package in the booking process.

                            You must complete a customs declaration form when shipping abroad. This will include a description of the goods, the value of them and the nature of them – in other words, whether they’re a gift, personal belongings or something you’ve sold.

                            The customs documents help Customs Officers:
							<br>
							<br>

							<b>(1) .Find out what’s inside the package</b><br>
							<b>(2) .Check if any customs duty and tax applies to your package</b>
							<br>
							<br>
                            During the booking process, we provides a simple form, which is easy to fill out and covers all the information required, so you don’t have to worry about missing anything out.</p>
					</div>
                    <div class="form-title">
						<h6><a id="question11"><b>WHAT IS DDU AND WHAT IS DDP?</b> </a></h6>
						<p>
							ADDU means ‘Delivered Duty Unpaid’, so when your package arrives at its destination country, the receiver will be contacted by customs to pay any customs duty owed before it will be released. If customs are not able to make contact with the recipient, the package could be returned or delayed, which is why it is essential to provide correct contact information. DDP on the other hand is (Delivered Duty Paid), which means the sender accepts all responsibility and costs associated with transporting the goods.

                           All packages shipped via our transport service are Delivered Duty Unpaid (DDU), which is much easier for the sender as each country we offer shipping to has different rules on what requires customs duty to be paid and how much. It is important therefore to declare the value of your items correctly and provide the correct contact details for the recipient, including telephone number and email address. This information should be provided to us during the booking process on the customs form, which should then be printed and attached to the outside of your box.

                           The most important thing about DDU is to make the recipient aware of customs charges which may be due. If you’re an online retailer, you should explain how taxes and duties will be handled in your shipping policy and include information on customs fees on your product pages, checkout process and any confirmation emails or FAQs.</p>
					</div>
			           <h6> * Please note that Delivered Duty Paid (DDP) whereby the sender is obligated to pay all customs fees is NOT something OAKS Express offers.</h6><br>
			        <div class="form-title">

						<h6><a id="question12"><b>WHY WILL MY PACKAGE BE SUBJECT TO CUSTOMS CHARGES?</b> </a></h6>
						<p>
							If you are shipping a package internationally, it could be subject to customs charges. The relevant customs teams in the destination country will set these charges based on the value of the goods you are sending.

                            We aim to make customs clearance simple by collecting all the relevant information in the booking process in order for your package to clear customs.  You should attach customs documents to the outside of your box in a clear plastic wallet or envelope. However sometimes, this may not still be enough.
						</p>
					    </div>
					   <div class="form-title">

						<h6><a id="question13"><b>CAN I PAY CUSTOMS DUTY BEFORE I SEND PACKAGE?</b> </a></h6>
						<p>
							All items sent via OAKS Express are DDU, which means the duty is unpaid. Any customs fees will need to be paid by the recipient. It is essential to provide local contact information so the recipient can be contacted by customs. The typical reason for this is that customs fees are never known until your package undergoes check by various customs officers from different countries during transport so there is no way the sender can pay before hand when no one knows the fee yet.
							There are a number of factors that can affect the amount of customs duty owed on an item including:

						</p>
						   <li>Reason for export</li>
						   <li>Country of export</li>
						   <li>Country of import</li>
						   <li>Product classification</li>
						   <li>Product material origin</li>
						   <li>Manufacturing country</li>
						   <li>Value of shipment</li>
						   <br>
						   <p>There is no way to avoid customs duties, customs officers will check all items entering the country and charges will be applied where necessary. If you simply put ‘gift’ on the customs invoice, this does not mean it will not attract duty as they will still check the value of what is in the box.
							   By giving a full breakdown of all the items in your package, including accurate values for each item and by providing correct contact details for the recipient, your package should clear customs with no issues after all payment has been made by the recipient. Providing incorrect or misleading customs information can result in additional costs, returned packages and delays.
						   </p>
					    </div>
					<div class="form-title">
						<h6><a id="question14"><b>MY TRACKING SAYS THERE IS AN ISSUE, WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b> </a></h6>

						<p>
							Tracking is useful for both the recipient and the sender, so you can check the progress of the delivery. If you are shipping a package internationally and you see a tracking scan such as ‘On Hold’ or ‘Held by Customs’ this means the recipient should have been contacted by one of our agent to make payment of any duty owed in order to release the package for delivery.

                             There are a couple of things you should do to make sure the package is delivered as quickly as possible:
							<br>
							<br>

							<b>(1)</b> .Contact the recipient to check they have been contacted by our agent in order to resolve all payment for the release of the package.<br>
							<b>(2)</b> .If they have not been contacted, you should get in touch with us and we can investigate to ensure the package is delivered.
							<br>
							<br>
                            It is essential to provide correct and accurate contact details so our agent can contact the recipient if any customs duty is owed. Failure to do this can result in long delays and the return of the package at the cost of the sender. It is also essential to complete the customs documents correctly and attach them securely to the outside of the box so that customs officers can see what is inside the package.

                            We have no gain in your customs charges. Our agent only liaise on the sender’s behalf with the carrier who then makes contact with customs in order to resolve any issues.

                            You should always make the recipient aware that backlogs in customs, could mean their package is delayed and this delay is out of the control of the shipper, carrier and the company.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="form-title">


						<h6><a id="question15"><b>WHO HAS TO PAY THE CUSTOMS DUTY AND HOW?</b> </a></h6>
						<p>If you choose to ship your packages through us, they will be shipped DDU (Delivered Duty Unpaid) which means it is the responsibility of the recipient to pay any customs duty.

                            When shipping internationally, you must provide accurate contact details for the recipient so that our agent in charge of your package can take payment of any customs duty owed and settle the customs officers so they can release the parcel for delivery. You should provide a local landline number and an accurate email address. Failure to do this can see the package being delayed or returned to the sender.

							One of our courier agent, mostly the one in charge of  your package will contact the recipient and set up the payment with them. Once paid, the customs will be settled in no time and the package will be released and put out for delivery.

                             You should always attach your customs forms to the outside of the box, so customs officers can easily check the value of the contents and work out the customs duty.</p>

						<h2><a id="question16"><b>Frequently asked questions on delivery</b>  </a></h2>
						<h6><b>HOW DO I TRACK MY PARCEL?</b></h6>

						<p>You can track the package you have sent using the ‘Track A Page‘ tab on the homepage menu. The tracking number will be sent via email to both the sender and recipient immediately after booking. Just input the tracking number in the field showing Enter Tracking Number and click on Track Result.</p>
					</div>
                    <div class="form-title">
						<h6><a id="question17"><b>DO YOU OFFER DOOR TO DOOR DELIVERY?</b> </a></h6>
						<p>
							With full tracking on almost all of our delivery services, you can follow your package from the moment it leaves you until it arrives with the recipient. We always advise providing the contact number of the recipient so that if needed, our agent in charge of your package can contact them to resolve any issues with the delivery.

                           Some of our carrier services are delivered to a local Post Office, where the recipient will need to collect the package from such as with DHL eCommerce to some remote areas so it is essential to provide a working contact number. Items shipped with through here are also done so DDU, so it might be that Customs need to collect payment from the recipient before delivery.

							<h6><a id="question19"><b>CAN YOU MAIL ALCOHOL?</b></a></h6>

						<p>The United States Postal Service (USPS) prohibits sending alcoholic beverages through the mail, but you can ship alcohol via carriers, such as FedEx or UPS if you’re a licensed alcohol shipper.

                            The laws around shipping liquor in the US are quite complicated, so if you’re considering setting up a business that ships alcohol, either within the US or internationally from the US, you should do plenty of research first.

                           FedEx and UPS have strict procedures for shipping alcohol and both require you to enter into an official Alcohol Shipping Agreement to use their services. There may be different shipping agreements required, depending on whether you’re shipping wine, beer or liquor and there are numerous restrictions on retailer to consumer shipments, including which US states you’re allowed to send consumer shipments to.
